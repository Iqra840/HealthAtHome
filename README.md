# Doc@home

The spread of the pandemic has caused a lot of changes in our lifestyle, people fearing to get outside their homes, transportation almost shut down and social distancing becoming all the more important. The three major health issues that we face during this pandemic are
- the deterioration of mental health due to lack of socialization 
- difficulty in getting medical appointments due to travel restrictions
- the uncontrolled spread of fake news. 

Doc@home is a web app build with an indention for helping to cope up with the current COVID situation.

The app has 3 main features:-


### 1. Became an AI companion for those in quarantine

‚ÄúConnectedness is important to all humans, so I think we are all at risk [of loneliness during quarantine],‚Äù 
       -   Deborah Roth Ledley, PhD, a licensed psychologist in Pennsylvania

 The new reality of prolonged quarantine period and lack of socialization with other family members, friends and managing the fear of contracting the virus and worry about people close to us who are particularly vulnerable, are all challenging for each one of us.  While the physical impact of COVID-19 can be assessed and treated, the mental impact is often ignored. Many people are experiencing emotional breakdowns and having depression. The new reality of prolonged quarantine period and lack of socialization are adding up the mental struggle. **More than 50% of those suffering from mental health issues are not seeking treatment, due to social stigma.** This present environment in the country has increased stress and anxiety amongst the citizens. 

Introducing to you Jessica, your very own AI companion. Jessica can help you overcome your isolation and loneliness.

### 2. Provide a connecting medium for doctors and patients  

But sometimes a chatbot might not be enough. You might need to seek professional help
The fear of traveling has resulted in the hampering of checkups of many people. **Doc@home, helps patients to take their routine checkups from the comfort of their homes without the scare of the virus.** It helps any patient to connect with the doctor of their choice, from the list of available doctors, and book an appointment according to their convenience either in offline or online mode.

The app has 2 portals, one for the patients requiring the appointment, and the doctors available for consultation. The patients can enter their medical history, any undergoing medication, etc which can be viewed by the doctor if he/she confirms their appointment. The index page of the patient and the doctor shows all their upcoming consultations. The doctor is notified if there are any patients requiring their appointment, and have the option to either confirm or deny, which causes a corresponding notification to be sent to the patient.
The doctor can also send the prescription with detailed feedback to the patient after consultation, along with the consultation fee to be paid. The patient can view the feedback in the history tab of their portal, which also provides the facility to pay the consultation fee by redirecting them to the Google Pay web page.

### 3. Create a forum for discussion between ordinary users and doctors

Another big issue that we face during this time, is the spreading of COVID related fake news.  News with no scientific basis like standing in sun can kill corona and your pets can spread CoronA are rapidly spreadly
**It is estimated there over 800 deaths have occurred due to WhatsApp fake msg**

Doc@home also tackles this issue

I have created a forum (inspired by stack overflow website) that could help people differentiate fake news from the real ones. Here people can raise doubts regarding different aspects of COVID and get answers from professionals. It is a community-driven platform where doctors and ordinary people can meet and help each other out. This forum, to some extend, would help ordinary people seek professional help and advice, and use it as a methodology to separate 
fake and actual news

**Although, it isn't much this is a humble step from my side hoping to bring our world to normalcy with the pandemic on the spread.**
